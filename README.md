<h1> Weather app</h1>
<h3> Following a Codedex tutorial</h3>

<p>Link: <a href="https://www.codedex.io/projects/view-weather-with-html-css-js"> Build a Weather app with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</a> </p>

<p>This web application allows you to find out the temperature and description of a city using a weather API </p>

<p>API used: <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">Open Weather API </a></p>

<h4>Progress:</h4>
<p>I have managed to get the code to run, there is still 1 error remaining. An unexpected character is appearing in the temperature section, to combat this I am going to research appending the temperature literal so it removes it automatically before displaying on the page.</p>
